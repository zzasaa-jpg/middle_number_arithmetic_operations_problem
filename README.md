# Middle number arithmetic operations

## Description:
Given an integer, find the middle value, perform the arithmetic operations. What is middle number? In any odd digit, the middle number is easily found by this formula **(Number length + 1) / 2**

E.g. => 112 is the integer middle number 1. In the formula =>

```
= (3 + 1) / 2
= 4 / 2
= 2
```
we count in numerical positions like (0, 10, 100...n).

```
1th position = 1
2th position = 10
3th position = 100
```

and so on.

After finding the middle number, perform the required arithmetic operations and return the output.

Solve using raw **C** and **C++**, focusing on strong fundamentals. Here uses the number logic, basic mathematics, knowledge of solving language(programming language).
